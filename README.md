I wanted to dive into how a metaverse was created. The two main tools I used were Solidity and React.js. I utilized Three.js for the 3D plane and environment. Ganache and Truffle assisted me in running and testing it on my local machine.

Once the application loads the following is what is seen. There is a blank 3D environment until the user connects their account via MetaMask.

The green plots of land are displayed once an account is connected. You can see which account you are currently using via the navbar. 
Users can click on each of the green plots of land to display information such as the name, owner, ID, and cost.

-----------------

If the land is not owned, then the user can purchase the property if they have enough funds in their account. 
If it is owned, then all the user can do is view the property's attributes.

The following images show what occurs when the user decides to buy a property.

--------------------

Now we can see that the property is owned. If a different account selects this property all they will see is the account that owns it.
